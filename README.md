# Weather Boilerplate App

Flutter Boilerplate project with Riverpod and SOLID principles for scalable and maintainable Flutter applications.

### Flutter 3.0.4 Null Safety ‚≠ê

## Features
- Automatically acquire user current location
- Search weather info by location

## How to Run
1. Create an account at [WeatherMap](http://www.weatherapi.com).

2. Then get your API key from https://www.weatherapi.com/my/

3. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.com/iamnabink/weather-app-boiler-plate.git
   ```
4. Install all the packages by typing
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
5. This app uses `freezed`,`auto_route_generator`,'json_serializable' libraries that works with code generation, execute the following command to generate files
   ```sh
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

5. Navigate to **assets/env** and paste your API key to the OPEN_API_KEY variable
   ```dart
   OPEN_API_KEY = Paste Your API Key Here
   ```
6. Run the App
